## Insertion Sort
Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted

[ 5, 3, 4, 1, 2 ]
[ 3, 5, 4, 1, 2 ]
[ 3, 4, 5, 1, 2 ]
[ 1, 3, 4, 5, 2 ]
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

- Start by picking the second element in the array
- Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if necessary.
- Continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through the sorted portion (i.e. the left side) to place the element in the correct place.
- Repeat until the array is sorted.
```cs
function insertionSort(arr){
	var currentVal;
    for(var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++){
        currentVal = arr[i];
        for(var j = i - 1; j >= 0 && arr[j] > currentVal; j--) {
            arr[j+1] = arr[j]
        }
        arr[j+1] = currentVal;
    }
    return arr;
}

insertionSort([2,1,9,76,4])
```


## Big O of insertion sort
Time complexity best: O(n)
Time complexity average: O(n²)

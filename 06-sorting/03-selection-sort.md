## Selection Sort
Look for smallert value and put it into front.

- Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
- Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
- If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum" and continue until the end of the array.
- If the "minimum" is not the value (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
- Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted.

```cs
function selectionSort(arr) {
  const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) =>
    ([arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]]);

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let lowest = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[lowest] > arr[j]) {
        lowest = j;
      }
    }
    if (i !== lowest) swap(arr, i, lowest);
  }

  return arr;
}

selectionSort([0,2,34,22,10,19,17]);
```


## Big O of selection sort
selection sort is better than bubble sort
O(nÂ²)
